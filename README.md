# Friend-Recommendation-Using-AI
Mapping the problem into binary classification problem where given two nodes in the friendship graph we need to classify
if can be friends or not.• We use simple featues like number of followers, number of followees, number of common followers
and followees to complex graph based features like katz centrality,Adar Index,the shortest path, connected components and
few distance based metric like Jaccard distance,Cosine distance.• We use Random Forests and SVM algorithm for the
classification task.
